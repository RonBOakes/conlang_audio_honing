Conlang Audio Honing testing notes:

- Changes can mess up sample texts even with the updates
-- Opened issue #54 to track this after realizing that the problem was with declined
   words.
- Missing phoneme in Kirshbaum coding.
- Metadata runs away.  Had to add code to account for this
- Found the gloss very useful in tracking down messed up words in sample texts.
- Added words in the lexicon editor do not automatically get the "root" declension.
