Conlang Audio Honing testing notes:

- Changes can mess up sample texts even with the updates
-- Opened issue #54 to track this after realizing that the problem was with declined
   words.
- Missing phoneme in Kirshbaum coding.
- Metadata runs away.  Had to add code to account for this
- Found the gloss very useful in tracking down messed up words in sample texts.
- Added words in the lexicon editor do not automatically get the "root" declension.
- Two related issues with regular expressions not properly matching.  The Python code
  used to build the CSV file used for translations and clean-up work would mess up 
  declension due to one bug, and the C# code would mess up derived words due to a 
  different bug.  Together these would result in myriad problems with words in sample
  texts not matching the lexicon.
- Because of working with languages that had been tweaked and changed since the initial 
  sample texts had been created, the texts had to be updated to the current languages before
  honing could start.  After some work was done, the best method was found to be:
  == Load the sample text into the Conlang Audio Honing tool and produce a phonetic representation
  == Open the lexicon editor and sort it using the "English" words.  The top entries will be the words
     that were "sounded out."
  == Match these with the sample.  If the sample text has a "gloss" version, this is helpful.  Find the 
     correct version and update the text(s) with the correct version.
- During honing additional capabilities were added for consonants:
  == In addition to being able to globally replace a consonant across the lexicon, it can be replaced
     at the start or end of words, everywhere but the start or end of words, or in or everywhere but 
     specific clusters.
